# titanic_survival
This is a Kaggle.com machine learning project. It has a training and a testing data set. The training data set has Titanic passenger information, such as- name, gender, age, embarked from which port and that individual survived or not. The testing data set has the same data, except its survival column is blank. We had to create a random forest based model to predict if a person has survived the sinking of Titanic or not.

I've used "sklearn" package in python to create the random forest model. Plotly was used to plot the data. I've plotted both the training data set and the predicted data which was generated by random forest model
